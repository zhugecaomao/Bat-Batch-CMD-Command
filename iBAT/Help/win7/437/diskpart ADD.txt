DISKPART> 
    Mirrors the simple volume with focus to the specified disk.

Syntax:  ADD DISK=<N> [ALIGN=<N>] [WAIT] [NOERR]

    DISK=<N>    Specifies a disk, other than the one containing the existing
                simple volume, to contain the mirror. You can mirror only
                simple volumes. The specified disk must have unallocated space
                at least as large as the size of the simple volume you want to
                mirror.

    ALIGN=<N>   Typically used with hardware RAID Logical Unit Number (LUN)
                arrays to improve performance. Aligns all volume extents to
                the closest alignment boundary. The extent offsets will be
                a multiple of <N>. 

    WAIT        Waits for the volume to finish synchronizing with the added
                disk before returning. Without the WAIT parameter, DiskPart
                returns after the mirrored volume is created and does not wait
                for the synchronization to complete.

    NOERR       For scripting only. When an error is encountered, DiskPart
                continues to process commands as if the error did not occur.
                Without the NOERR parameter, an error causes DiskPart to exit
                with an error code.

    A volume must be selected for this operation to succeed.    
    
    Fault-tolerant volumes such as RAID-5 and mirrored volumes are not
    supported in any edition of Windows Vista.
    

Example:

    ADD DISK=2
