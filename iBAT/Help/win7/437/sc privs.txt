DESCRIPTION:
        Changes the required privileges setting of a service. 
        The privilege settings take effect when the
        service process starts due to the first service in
        the process being started. At that time, the Service 
        Control Manager (SCM) computes the union of all privileges 
        required by all services that will be hosted in the same
        process and then creates the process with those
        privileges. An absence of this setting is taken to imply
        that the service requires all the privileges that
        the security subsystem allows for the process running
        in the service's configured account.

USAGE:
        sc <server> privs [service name] [privileges]

OPTIONS:        
        privileges = <Privileges(separated by / (forward slash))>
                     [E.g., SeBackupPrivilege/SeRestorePrivilege]
