DISKPART> 
    Removes a drive letter or mounted folder pathname from the volume 
    with focus.

Syntax:  REMOVE [LETTER=<D> | MOUNT=<PATH> | ALL] [DISMOUNT] [NOERR]

    LETTER=<D>  The drive letter to be removed.

    MOUNT=<PATH>

                The mounted folder path to be removed.

    ALL         Removes all current drive letters and mounted folder paths.

    DISMOUNT    This parameter may be used if 1) all drive letters and 
                mounted folder paths have been removed from the volume, or 
                2) the ALL parameter is specified.  This parameter 
                specifies that the file system is to be dismounted and 
                the volume taken offline. If other processes are using 
                the volume, DiskPart closes any open handles before
                dismounting the file system and taking the volume offline. 
                You can bring the volume online by assigning it a driver 
                letter, by creating a mounted folder path to the volume, or 
                by using the ONLINE command. DISMOUNT will fail if used 
                on a volume that has any remaining drive letters or mounted 
                folder paths. For scripting, using REMOVE ALL DISMOUNT is 
                recommended.

    NOERR       For scripting only. When an error is encountered, DiskPart
                continues to process commands as if the error did not occur.
                Without the NOERR parameter, an error causes DiskPart to exit
                with an error code.

    If no drive letter or mounted folder path is specified, DiskPart removes
    the first drive letter or mounted folder path it encounters. If the ALL 
    parameter is used, all current drive letters and mounted folder paths 
    are removed. If the DISMOUNT parameter is used, DiskPart closes all open 
    handles to the volume and then dismounts the volume and takes it offline.

    The REMOVE command can be used to change the drive letter associated with a
    removable drive. You cannot remove the drive letters on boot or
    paging volumes. 
    
    A volume must be selected for this operation to succeed.

Example:

    REMOVE LETTER=K
    REMOVE MOUNT=G:\MountH
    REMOVE ALL DISMOUNT
