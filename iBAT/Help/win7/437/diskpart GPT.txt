    On basic GUID partition table (GPT) disks, assigns the GPT attribute(s) to
    the partition with focus.

Syntax:  GPT ATTRIBUTES=<N>

    ATTRIBUTES=<N>

                The hexadecimal value indicating the attributes to apply to the
                partition with focus. The GPT attribute field is a 64-bit field
                that contains two subfields. The higher field is interpreted
                only in the context of a particular partition type GUID, while
                the lower field is common to all partition types.

                The following attribute can be set on any partition:

                0x0000000000000001 marks the partition as required. This
                indicates to all disk management utilities that the partition
                should not be deleted. The EFI System partition contains only
                those binaries necessary to start the operating system. This
                makes it easy for original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or 
                operating system-specific binaries to be placed in other 
                partitions.

                For basic data partitions, the following attributes are defined:

                0x8000000000000000
                GPT_BASIC_DATA_ATTRIBUTE_NO_DRIVE_LETTER 
                Prevents the partition from having a drive
                letter automatically assigned. By default, each partition is
                assigned a new drive letter and a volume GUID pathname. Both 
                the drive letter and the volume GUID pathname can be used to 
                open the volume using Win32 APIs. Setting this attribute ensures
                that when a disk is moved to a new computer, a new drive letter
                will not be automatically generated. Instead, the user can
                manually assign drive letters.

                0x4000000000000000
                GPT_BASIC_DATA_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN 
                Defines the partition's volume as hidden. 
                Setting this attribute specifies that the volume will not be 
                assigned a drive letter or a volume GUID pathname. Both 
                the drive letter and the volume GUID pathname can be used to 
                open the volume using Win32 APIs. A hidden partition's 
                volume is not reported by Win32 APIs such as FindFirstVolume 
                and FindNextVolume.

                0x2000000000000000
                GPT_BASIC_DATA_ATTRIBUTE_SHADOW_COPY
                Defines the partition as being a Volume Snapshot Service 
                shadow copy volume. Fle system filters use this flag to 
                prevent the filter from attaching to the volume.

                0x1000000000000000 
                GPT_BASIC_DATA_ATTRIBUTE_READ_ONLY
                Prevents the volume from being written to. 

                Other attributes may be added by Microsoft at any time.

    GPT partition attributes give additional information about the use of the
    partition. 
    
    A basic GPT partition must be selected for this operation to succeed.

    Caution:

        Changing the GPT attributes might cause your basic data volumes to
        fail to be assigned drive letters, or prevent the file system from 
        mounting. Unless you are an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) 
        or an IT professional experienced with GPT disks, do not change GPT 
        attributes.

Example:

    GPT ATTRIBUTES=0x8000000000000000
    GPT ATTRIBUTES=0xF000000000000001
