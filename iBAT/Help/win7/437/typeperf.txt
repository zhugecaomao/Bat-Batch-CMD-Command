Note:
  Counter is the full name of a performance counter in
  "\\<Computer>\<Object>(<Instance>)\<Counter>" format,
  such as "\\Server1\Processor(0)\% User Time".

Examples:
  typeperf "\Processor(_Total)\% Processor Time"
  typeperf -cf counters.txt -si 5 -sc 50 -f TSV -o domain2.tsv
  typeperf -qx PhysicalDisk -o counters.txt
