DISKPART> 
    Imports a foreign disk group into the local computer's online disk group.

Syntax:  IMPORT [NOERR]

    NOERR       For scripting only. When an error is encountered, DiskPart
                continues to process commands as if the error did not occur.
                Without the NOERR parameter, an error causes DiskPart to exit
                with an error code.

    The command imports every disk that is in the same group as the disk with
    focus.

    A dynamic disk must be selected for this operation to succeed.

Example:

    IMPORT

DISKPART>
