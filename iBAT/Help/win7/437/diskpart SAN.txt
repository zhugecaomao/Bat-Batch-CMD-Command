DISKPART> 
    Displays or sets the SAN policy for the operating system.

Syntax:  SAN [POLICY={OnlineAll | OfflineAll | OfflineShared}] [NOERR]

    SAN             If the command is given with no parameters, the current
                    SAN policy is displayed.

    POLICY=<value>  Sets the SAN policy for the currently booted operating
                    system.

    NOERR       For scripting only. When an error is encountered, DiskPart
                continues to process commands as if the error did not occur.
                Without the NOERR parameter, an error causes DiskPart to exit
                with an error code.

    This command allows the user to display or change the SAN policy for the
    currently booted OS. The default policy for Windows Advanced Server and
    Windows Data Center is OfflineShared. In this case the boot disk will
    be brought online, as will all disks that are not located on a shared bus
    such as SCSI, iSCSI, SAS, etc. The offlined disks will be read-only by
    default. On all other versions of Windows, the default will be to bring
    all disks online. In this case, the disks will be online and read/write.
    The third policy value is OfflineAll. For this case, all disks except the
    boot disk will be offline and read-only by default.

Examples:

    SAN
    SAN POLICY=OfflineAll
