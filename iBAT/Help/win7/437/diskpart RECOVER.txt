DISKPART> 
   Refreshes the state of all disks in the selected pack, attempts recovery
   on disks in the invalid pack, and, resynchronizes mirrored volumes and
   RAID-5 volumes that have stale plex or parity data.


Syntax:  RECOVER [NOERR]

    NOERR       For scripting only. When an error is encountered, DiskPart
                continues to process commands as if the error did not occur.
                Without the NOERR parameter, an error causes DiskPart to exit
                with an error code.

    This command operates on a pack. A disk that is part of a pack must be 
    selected for this operation to succeed.

    This command is only applicable to dynamic disks. If called on a
    basic disk, it will succeed but no action is taken.

Example:

    RECOVER

DISKPART>
