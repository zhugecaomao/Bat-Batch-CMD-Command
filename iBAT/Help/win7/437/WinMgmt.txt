Usage:  winmgmt [/backup <filename>] [/restore <filename> <flag>]
                [/resyncperf] [/standalonehost [<level>]] [/sharedhost]
                [/verifyrepository [<path>]] [/salvagerepository]
                [/resetrepository]

/backup <filename>
        Causes WMI to back up the repository to the specified file name. The
        filename argument should contain the full path to the file location.
        This process requires a write lock on the repository so that write
        operations to the repository are suspended until the backup process is
        completed.

/restore <filename> <flag>
        Manually restores the WMI repository from the specified backup file.
        The filename argument should contain the full path to the backup file
        location. To perform the restore operation, WMI saves the existing
        repository to write back if the operation fails. Then the repository is
        restored from the backup file that is specified in the filename
        argument. If exclusive access to the repository cannot be achieved,
        existing clients are disconnected from WMI. The flag argument must be a
        1 (force - disconnect users and restore) or 0 (default - restore if no
        users connected) and specifies the restore mode.

/resyncperf
        Registers the system performance libraries with WMI.

/standalonehost [<level>]
        Moves the Winmgmt service to a standalone Svchost process that has a
        fixed DCOM endpoint. The default endpoint is "ncacn_ip_tcp.0.24158".
        However, the endpoint may be changed by running Dcomcnfg.exe. The level
        argument is the authentication level for the Svchost process. If level
        is not specified, the default is 4 (RPC_C_AUTHN_LEVEL_PKT).

/sharedhost
        Moves the Winmgmt service into the shared Svchost process.

/verifyrepository [<path>]
        Performs a consistency check on the WMI repository. When you add the
        /verifyrepository switch without the <path> argument, then the live
        repository currently used by WMI is verified. When you specify the path
        argument, you can verify any saved copy of the repository. In this
        case, the path argument should contain the full path to the saved
        repository copy. The saved repository should be a copy of the entire
        repository folder.

/salvagerepository
        Performs a consistency check on the WMI repository, and if an
        inconsistency is detected, rebuilds the repository.  The content of the
        inconsistent repository is merged into the rebuilt repository, if it
        can be read. The salvage operation always works with the repository
        that the WMI service is currently using. MOF files that contain the
        #pragma autorecover preprocessor statement are restored to the
        repository.

/resetrepository
        The repository is reset to the initial state when the operating system
        is first installed. MOF files that contain the #pragma autorecover
        preprocessor statement are restored to the repository.
