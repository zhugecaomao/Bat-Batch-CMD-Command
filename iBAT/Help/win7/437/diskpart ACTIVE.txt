DISKPART> 
    On disks with master boot record (MBR) disk formatting, marks 
    the partition with focus as active.

Syntax:  ACTIVE

    Writes a value to the disk which is read by the basic input/output 
    system (BIOS) at boot. This value specifies that the partition is 
    a valid system partition.

    A partition must be selected for this operation to succeed.

    Caution:

        DiskPart verifies only that the partition is capable of containing the
        operating system startup files. DiskPart does not check the contents of
        the partition. If you mistakenly mark a partition as active and it does
        not contain the operating system startup files, your computer might not
        start.

Example:

    ACTIVE
