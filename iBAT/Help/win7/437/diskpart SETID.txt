    Changes the partition type field for the partition with focus.

Syntax:  SET ID={<BYTE> | <GUID>} [OVERRIDE] [NOERR]

    ID={<BYTE> | <GUID>}

                Specifies the new partition type.

                For master boot record (MBR) disks, you can specify a partition
                type byte, in hexadecimal form, for the partition. Any
                partition type byte can be specified with this parameter except
                for type 0x42 (LDM partition). Note that the leading '0x' is 
                omitted when specifying the hexadecimal partition type.

                For GUID partition table (GPT) disks you can specify a
                partition type GUID for the partition. Recognized GUIDs
                include:

                    EFI System partition:
                        c12a7328-f81f-11d2-ba4b-00a0c93ec93b

                    Basic data partition:
                        ebd0a0a2-b9e5-4433-87c0-68b6b72699c7

                Any partition type GUID can be specified with this parameter
                except for the following:

                    Microsoft Reserved partition:
                        e3c9e316-0b5c-4db8-817d-f92df00215ae

                    LDM Metadata partition on a dynamic disk:
                        5808c8aa-7e8f-42e0-85d2-e1e90434cfb3

                    LDM Data partition on a dynamic disk:
                        af9b60a0-1431-4f62-bc68-3311714a69ad
                        
                    Cluster Metadata partition:
                        db97dba9-0840-4bae-97f0-ffb9a327c7e1   


                Other than the limitations mentioned, DiskPart otherwise does
                not check the partition type for validity except to ensure that
                it is a byte in hexadecimal form or a GUID.

    OVERRIDE    Enables DiskPart to force the file system on the volume to 
                dismount before changing the partition type. When changing
                the partition type, DiskPart will attempt to lock and dismount
                the file system on the volume. If this parameter is not specified, 
                and the call to lock the file system fails, (because some other
                application has an open handle to the volume), the entire 
                operation will fail. When this parameter is specified, the 
                dismount is forced even if the call to lock the file system 
                fails. When a file system is dismounted, all opened handles to 
                the volume will become invalid. 

    NOERR       For scripting only. When an error is encountered, DiskPart
                continues to process commands as if the error did not occur.
                Without the NOERR parameter, an error causes DiskPart to exit
                with an error code.

    Intended for Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) use only.

    A partition must be selected for this operation to succeed.

    Caution:

        Changing partition type fields with this parameter might cause your
        computer to fail or be unable to start up. Unless you are an OEM or an
        IT professional experienced with GPT disks, do not change partition
        type fields on GPT disks using this parameter. Instead, always use the
        CREATE PARTITION EFI command to create EFI System partitions, the
        CREATE PARTITION MSR command to create Microsoft Reserved partitions,
        and the CREATE PARTITION PRIMARY command without the ID parameter to
        create primary partitions on GPT disks.

    This command does not work on dynamic disks nor on Microsoft Reserved
    partitions.

    Example:

    SET ID=07 OVERRIDE
    SET ID=ebd0a0a2-b9e5-4433-87c0-68b6b72699c7
