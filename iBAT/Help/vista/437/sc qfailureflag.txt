DESCRIPTION:
        Retrieves the failure actions flag setting of a service. 
        If this setting is 0 (default), the Service Control Manager 
        (SCM) enables configured failure actions on the service
        only if the service process terminates with the service in
        a state other than SERVICE_STOPPED. If this setting is 1, 
        the SCM enables configured failure actions on the service
        if the service enters the SERVICE_STOPPED state with a Win32 
        exit code other than 0 in addition to the service process 
        termination as above. This setting is ignored if the service 
        does not have any failure actions configured.
USAGE:
        sc <server> qfailureflag [service name]
