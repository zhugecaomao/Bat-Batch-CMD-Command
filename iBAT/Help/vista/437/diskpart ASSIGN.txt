    Assigns a drive letter or mount point to the volume with focus.

Syntax:  ASSIGN [LETTER=<D> | MOUNT=<PATH>] [NOERR]

    LETTER=<D>  The drive letter to assign to the volume.

    MOUNT=<PATH>

                The mount point path to assign to the volume.

    NOERR       For scripting only. When an error is encountered, DiskPart
                continues to process commands as if the error did not occur.
                Without the NOERR parameter, an error causes DiskPart to exit
                with an error code.

    If no drive letter or mount point is specified, the next available drive
    letter is assigned. If the drive letter or mount point is already in use,
    an error is generated.

    By using the assign command, you can change the drive letter associated
    with a removable drive.

    You cannot assign drive letters to system volumes, boot volumes, or volumes
    that contain the paging file. In addition, you cannot assign a drive letter
    to an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) partition or any GUID Partition
    Table (GPT) partition other than a basic data partition.

    A volume must be selected for this operation to succeed.

Example:

    ASSIGN LETTER=D
