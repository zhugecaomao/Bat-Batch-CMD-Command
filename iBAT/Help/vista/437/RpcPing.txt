Pings a server using RPC. Options are:

-t <protseq> - protocol sequence to use. Can be one of the standard
    RPC protocol sequences - ncacn_ip_tcp, ncacn_np, ncacn_http, etc.
    If not specified, default is ncacn_ip_tcp.
    
-s <server_addr> - the server address. If not specified, the local
    machine will be pinged. E.g. server, server.com, 157.59.244.141
        
-e <endpoint> - the endpoint to ping. If none is specified, the endpoint
    mapper on the target machine will be pinged. This option is mutually
    exclusive with the interface (-f) option.

-o <binding_options> - the binding options for the RPC ping. See the
    MSDN for more details (RpcStringBindingCompose and RPC over HTTP).
    
-f <interface UUID>[,MajorVer] - the interface to ping. This option is
    mutually exclusive with the endpoint option. The interface is specified
    as a UUID. If the MajorVer is not specified, version 1 of the interface
    will be sought. When interface is specified, rpcping will query the
    endpoint mapper on the target machine to retrieve the endpoint for the
    specified interface. The endpoint mapper will be queried using the
    options specified in the command line.
    
-O <Object UUID> - Object Uuid if the interface registerd one.

-i <#_iterations> - number of calls to make. The default is 1. This
    option is useful for measuring connection latency if multiple
    iterations are specified.
    
-u <security_package_id> - the security package (security provider) RPC
    will use to make the call. The security package is identified as a
    number or a name. If a number is used it is the same number as in the
    RpcBindingSetAuthInfoEx API. The table below gives the names and
    numbers. Names are not case sensitive:
        Negotiate - 9 or one of nego, snego or negotiate
        NTLM - 10 or NTLM
        SChannel - 14 or SChannel
        Kerberos - 16 or Kerberos
    If you specify this option you must specify authentication level other
    than none. There is no default for this option. If it is not specified,
    RPC will not use security for the ping.
    
-a <authn_level> - the authentication level to use. Possible values are
    connect, call, pkt, integrity and privacy. If this option is
    specified, the security package id (-u) must also be specified. There
    is no default for this option. If this option is not specified, RPC
    will not use security for the ping.


-N <server_princ_name> - specifies a server principal name. Same semantics
    as the ServerPrincName argument to RpcBindingSetAuthInfoEx. See the
    MSDN for more information on RpcBidningSetAuthInfoEx. This field can be
    used only when authentication level and security package are selected.
    
-I <auth_identity> - allows you to specify alternative identity to connect
    to the server. The identity is in the form user,domain,password where
    the three fields have the obvious meaning. If the user name, domain or
    password have special characters that can be interpreted by the shell
    be sure to enclose the identity in double quotes. You can specify *
    instead of the password and RPC will prompt you to enter the password
    without echoing it on the screen. If this field is not specified, the
    identity of the logged on user will be used. This field can be used
    only when authentication level and security package are selected.
  
-C <capabilities> - a hex bitmask of flags. It has the same meaning as
    the Capabilities field in the RPC_SECURITY_QOS structure described
    in the MSDN. This field can be used only when authentication level and
    security package are selected.
    
-T <identity_tracking> - can be static or dynamic. If not specified,
    dynamic is the default. This field can be used only when authentication
    level and security package are selected.

-M <impersonation_type> - can be anonymous, identify, impersonate or
    delegate. Default is impersonate. This field can be used only when
    authentication level and security package are selected.  


-S <server_sid> - the expected SID of the server. For more information
    see the Sid field in the RPC_SECURITY_QOS structure in the MSDN. Using      
    this option requires Windows .NET Server 2003 or higher. This field can
    be used only when authentication level and security package are
    selected.
    
-P <proxy_auth_identity> - specifies the identity to authenticate with to
    the RPC/HTTP proxy. Has the same format as for the -I option. 
    Also, you must specify security package (-u), authentication level 
    (-a), and authentication schemes (-H) in order to use this option.
    
-F <RPCHTTP_flags> - the flags to pass for RPC/HTTP front end
    authentication. The flags may be specified as numbers or names
    The currently recognized flags are:
        Use SSL - 1 or ssl or use_ssl
        Use first auth scheme - 2 or first or use_first
    See the Flags field in RPC_HTTP_TRANSPORT_CREDENTIALS for more 
    information. Also, you must specify security package (-u) and 
    authentication level (-a) in order to use this option.
    
-H <RPC/HTTP_authn_schemes> - the authentication schemes to use for
    RPC/HTTP front end authentication. This option is a list of numerical
    values or names separated by comma. E.g. Basic,NTLM. Recognized values
    are (names are not case sensitive:
        Basic - 1 or Basic
        NTLM - 2 or NTLM
        Certificate - 65536 or Cert
    Also, you must specify security package (-u) and authentication level 
    (-a) in order to use this option.
    
-B <server_certificate_subject> - the server certificate subject. For
    more information, see the ServerCertificateSubject field in the
    RPC_HTTP_TRANSPORT_CREDENTIALS structure in the MSDN. You must use
    SSL for this option to work. Also, you must specify security package 
    (-u) and authentication level (-a) in order to use this option.
    
-b - retrieves the server certificate subject from the certificate sent
    by the server and prints it to a screen or a log file. Valid only when
    the Proxy Echo only option (-E) and the use SSL options are specified.
    Also, you must specify security package (-u) and authentication level 
    (-a) in order to use this option.
    
-R - specifies the HTTP proxy. if it's 'none', we will not use HTTP proxy but
    directly attempt the RPC proxy. the value 'default' means to use the IE
    settings in your client machine. any other value will be treated as the
    explicit HTTP proxy. if you don't specify this flag, the default value
    is assumed, that is, the IE settings are checked. this flag is valid
    only when the -E (Echo Only) flag is enabled.


-E - restricts the ping to the RPC/HTTP proxy only. The ping does not
    reach the server. Useful when trying to establish whether the RPC/HTTP
    proxy is reachable. Also, you must specify security package (-u) and 
    authentication level (-a) in order to use this option. To specify an 
    HTTP proxy, use the -R flag. If an HTTP proxy is specified in the -o 
    flag, this option will be ignored.
 
-q - quiet mode. Does not issue any prompts except for passwords. Assumes
    'Y' response to all queries. Use this option with care.
    
-c - use smart card certificate. RPCPing will prompt user to choose
    smart card.
    
-A <http_proxy_auth_identity> - specifies the identity to authenticate
    with to the HTTP proxy. Has the same format as for the -I option. 
    Also, you must specify authentication schemes (-U), security package 
    (-u) and authentication level (-a) in order to use this option.
    
-U <HTTP_proxy_authn_schemes> - the authentication schemes to use for
    HTTP proxy authentication. This option is a list of numerical
    values or names separated by comma. E.g. Basic,NTLM. Recognized values 
    are (names are not case sensitive:
        Basic - 1 or Basic
        NTLM - 2 or NTLM
    You must specify security package (-u) and authentication level (-a) 
    in order to use this option.

-r <report_results_interval> - if multiple iterations are specified, this
    option will make rpcping display current execution statistics
    periodically instead after the last call. The report interval is given
    in seconds. Default is 15.
    
-v <verbose_level> - tells rpcping how verbose to make the output. Default
    value is 1. 2 and 3 provide more output from rpcping.

-d - launch RPC network diagnostic UI
        
Example: Find out if your Exchange server that you connect through
RPC/HTTP is accessible:
    rpcping -t ncacn_http -s exchange_server -o RpcProxy=front_end_proxy
        -P "username,domain,*" -H Basic -u NTLM -a connect -F 3
When prompted for the password, enter it. exchange_server is the name of
your exchange server, front_end_proxy is the name of your proxy, username
and domain are your user name and domain as you would enter them in the
Outlook prompt. The other parameters will ask rpcping to ping your
Exchange server in exactly the same way as Outlook will connect to it for
the typical profile.
