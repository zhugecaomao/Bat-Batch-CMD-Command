Value         Description

<volume>      Specifies the drive letter or mount point path of the volume to
              be defragmented or analyzed.

-c            Defragments all volumes on this computer.

-a            Performs fragmentation analysis only.

-r            Performs partial defragmentation (default). Attempts to
              consolidate only fragments smaller than 64 megabytes (MB).

-w            Performs full defragmentation. Attempts to consolidate all file
              fragments, regardless of their size.

-f            Forces defragmentation of the volume when free space is low.

-v            Specifies verbose mode. The defragmentation and analysis output
              is more detailed.
