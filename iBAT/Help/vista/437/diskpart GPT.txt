    On basic GUID partition table (GPT) disks, assigns the GPT attribute(s) to
    the partition with focus.

Syntax:  GPT ATTRIBUTES=<N>

    ATTRIBUTES=<N>

                The hexadecimal value indicating the attributes to apply to the
                partition with focus. The GPT attribute field is a 64-bit field
                that contains two subfields. The higher field is interpreted
                only in the context of a particular partition type GUID, while
                the lower field is common to all partition types.

                All partitions have the following attribute:

                0x0000000000000001 marks the partition as required. This
                indicates to all disk management utilities that the partition
                should not be deleted. The EFI System partition contains only
                those binaries necessary to start the operating system. This
                makes it easy for OEM- or operating system-specific binaries to
                be placed in other partitions.

                For basic data partitions, the following attribute is defined:

                0x8000000000000000 prevents the partition from having a drive
                letter automatically assigned. By default, each partition is
                assigned a new drive letter. Setting this attribute ensures
                that when a disk is moved to a new computer, a new drive letter
                will not be automatically generated. Instead, the user can
                manually assign drive letters.

                Other attributes can be added at any time.

    GPT partition attributes give additional information about the use of the
    partition. Some attributes are specific to the partition type GUID.

    A basic GPT partition must be selected for this operation to succeed.

    Caution:

        Changing the GPT attributes might cause your basic data volumes to be
        unmountable or fail to be assigned drive letters. Unless you are an
        original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or an IT professional experienced
        with GPT disks, do not change GPT attributes.

Example:

    GPT ATTRIBUTES=0x8000000000000000
