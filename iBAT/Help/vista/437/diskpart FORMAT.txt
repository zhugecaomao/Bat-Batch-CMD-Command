DISKPART> 
    Formats the specified volume for use with Windows.

Syntax:  FORMAT [[FS=<FS>] [REVISION=<X.XX>] | RECOMMENDED] [LABEL=<"label">]
            [UNIT=<N>] [QUICK] [COMPRESS] [OVERRIDE] [NOWAIT] [NOERR]

    FS=<FS>     Specifies the type of file system. If no file system is given,
                the default file system displayed by the FILESYSTEMS command is
                used.

    REVISION=<X.XX>

                Specifies the file system revision (if applicable).

    RECOMMENDED If specified, use the recommended file system and revision
                instead of the default if a recommendation exists. The
                recommended file system (if one exists) is displayed by the
                FILESYSTEMS command.

    LABEL=<"label">

                Specifies the volume label.

    UNIT=<N>    Overrides the default allocation unit size. Default settings
                are strongly recommended for general use. The default
                allocation unit size for a particular file system is displayed
                by the FILESYSTEMS command.

                NTFS compression is not supported for allocation unit sizes
                above 4096.

    QUICK       Performs a quick format.

    COMPRESS    NTFS only: Files created on the new volume will be compressed
                by default.

    OVERRIDE    Forces the volume to dismount first if necessary. All opened
                handles to the volume would no longer be valid.

    NOWAIT      Forces the command to return immediately while the format
                process is still in progress. If NOWAIT is not specified,
                DiskPart will display format progress in percentage.

    NOERR       For scripting only. When an error is encountered, DiskPart
                continues to process commands as if the error did not occur.
                Without the NOERR parameter, an error causes DiskPart to exit
                with an error code.

    A volume must be selected for this operation to succeed.

Examples:

    FORMAT FS=NTFS LABEL="New Volume" QUICK COMPRESS
    FORMAT RECOMMENDED OVERRIDE
