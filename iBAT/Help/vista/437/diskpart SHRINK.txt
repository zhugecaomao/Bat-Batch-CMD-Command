DISKPART> 
    Reduces the size of the volume with focus by the specified amount. Makes
    free disk space available from unused space at the end of the volume.

Syntax:  SHRINK [DESIRED=<N>] [MINIMUM=<N>] [NOWAIT] [NOERR]
        SHRINK QUERYMAX [NOERR]

    DESIRED=<N> Specifies the desired amount of space in megabytes (MB) to
                reduce the size of the volume by. If a desired amount is not
                specified, the volume will be reduced by the maximum amount of
                free space available on the volume.

    MINIMUM=<N> Specifies the minimum amount of space in MB to reduce the size
                of the volume by.

    QUERYMAX    Returns the maximum number of bytes that the volume can be
                reduced by (the free space available on the volume). This
                value may change if applications are currently accessing the
                volume.

    NOWAIT      Forces the command to return immediately while the shrink
                process is still in progress.

    NOERR       For scripting only. When an error is encountered, DiskPart
                continues to process commands as if the error did not occur.
                Without the NOERR parameter, an error causes DiskPart to exit
                with an error code.

    If a MINIMUM amount is not specified, the volume will be reduced by either
    the DESIRED amount (if specified), or by the maximum amount of free space
    available on the volume. If a MINIMUM amount is specified but not enough
    free space is available, the command will fail.

    This command works on basic volumes, and on simple or spanned dynamic
    volumes. You can reduce the size of a volume only if it is formatted using
    the NTFS file system or if it does not have a file system.

    A volume must be selected for this operation to succeed.

Examples:

    SHRINK DESIRED=500 MINIMUM=250
    SHRINK QUERYMAX
