DISKPART> 
    Removes a drive letter or mount point from the volume with focus.

Syntax:  REMOVE [LETTER=<D> | MOUNT=<PATH> | ALL] [DISMOUNT] [NOERR]

    LETTER=<D>  The drive letter to be removed.

    MOUNT=<PATH>

                The mount point path to be removed.

    ALL         Removes all current drive letters and mount points.

    DISMOUNT    Dismounts the basic volume, when all drive letters and mount
                points have been removed from the volume, and takes the basic
                volume offline, making it unmountable. If other processes are
                using the volume, DiskPart closes any open handles before
                dismounting the volume. You can make the volume mountable by
                assigning it a driver letter or by creating a mount point path
                to the volume. Dismount will fail if used on a volume that has
                any remaining drive letters or mount points. For scripting,
                using remove all dismount is recommended.

    NOERR       For scripting only. When an error is encountered, DiskPart
                continues to process commands as if the error did not occur.
                Without the NOERR parameter, an error causes DiskPart to exit
                with an error code.

    If no drive letter or mount point is specified, DiskPart removes the first
    drive letter or mount point it encounters. If the all parameter is used,
    all current drive letters and mount points are removed. If the dismount
    parameter is used, DiskPart closes all open handles to the volume and then
    dismounts it.

    The remove command can be used to change the drive letter associated with a
    removable drive. You cannot remove the drive letters on system, boot, or
    paging volumes. In addition, you cannot remove the drive letter for an
    original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partition, any GUID partition table
    (GPT) partition with an unrecognized GUID, or any of the special, non-data,
    GPT partitions such as the EFI System partition.

    A volume must be selected for this operation to succeed.

Example:

    REMOVE LETTER=K
    REMOVE ALL DISMOUNT
