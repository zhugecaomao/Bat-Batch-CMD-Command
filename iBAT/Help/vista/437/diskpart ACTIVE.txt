DISKPART> 
    On basic master boot record (MBR) disks, marks the partition with focus as
    active.

Syntax:  ACTIVE

    This informs the basic input/output system (BIOS) that the partition is a
    valid system partition.

    A partition must be selected for this operation to succeed.

    Caution:

        DiskPart verifies only that the partition is capable of containing the
        operating system startup files. DiskPart does not check the contents of
        the partition. If you mistakenly mark a partition as active and it does
        not contain the operating system startup files, your computer might not
        start.

Example:

    ACTIVE
