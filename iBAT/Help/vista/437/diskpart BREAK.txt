DISKPART> 
    Breaks the mirrored volume with focus into two simple volumes.

Syntax:  BREAK DISK=<N> [NOKEEP] [NOERR]

    DISK=<N>    Specifies the disk that contains the mirrored volume. This disk
                is given focus and does not retain the drive letter or any
                mount points. If the mirror on the specified disk is used as a
                system or boot partition, the command fails.

    NOKEEP      Specifies that only one of the mirrored volumes is retained;
                the simple volume on disk N is deleted and converted to free
                space. Neither the volume nor the free space receives the
                focus.

    NOERR       For scripting only. When an error is encountered, DiskPart
                continues to process commands as if the error did not occur.
                Without the NOERR parameter, an error causes DiskPart to exit
                with an error code.

    Applies to dynamic disks only. Breaks the mirrored volume with focus into
    two simple volumes. One simple volume retains the drive letter and any
    mount points of the mirrored volume. The other simple volume receives the
    focus so you can assign it a drive letter.

    By default, the contents of both halves of the mirror are retained. Each
    half becomes a simple volume. By using the NOKEEP parameter, you retain
    only one half of the mirror as a simple volume, and the other half is
    deleted and converted to free space. Neither volume receives the focus.

    A mirrored volume must be selected for this operation to succeed.

Example:

    BREAK DISK=2
