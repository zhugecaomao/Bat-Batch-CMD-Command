DISKPART> 
    On basic master boot record (MBR) disks, marks the partition with focus as
    inactive.

Syntax:  INACTIVE

    The computer may start from the next option specified in the BIOS such as a
    CD-ROM drive or a Pre-Boot eXecution Environment (PXE)-based boot
    environment (such as Remote Installation Services (RIS)) when you restart
    the computer.

    A partition must be selected for this operation to succeed.

    Caution:

        Your computer might not start without an active partition. Do not mark
        a system or boot partition as inactive unless you are an experienced
        user with a thorough understanding of Windows storage management.
