DISKPART> 
   Refreshes the state of all disks in the selected pack, attempts recovery
   on disks in the invalid pack and resynchronizes mirrored volumes and
   RAID5 volumes that have stale plex or parity data.


Syntax:  RECOVER [NOERR]

    NOERR       For scripting only. When an error is encountered, DiskPart
                continues to process commands as if the error did not occur.
                Without the NOERR parameter, an error causes DiskPart to exit
                with an error code.

    This command operates on a pack.
    A disk that is part of a pack must be selected for this operation
    to succeed.

    This command is only applicable to dynamic disks. If called on a
    basic disk, it will succeed but no action is taken.

    If a dynamic disk is selected, this command refreshes the state of all
    disks in the selected pack, attempts recovery on disks in the invalid
    pack and resynchronizes mirrored volumes and RAID5 volumes that have
    stale plex or parity data.

    This command operates on disks that are failed or failing. It also
    operates on volumes that are failed, failing, or in failed redundancy
    state.

Example:

    RECOVER
