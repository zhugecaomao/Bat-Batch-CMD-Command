DISKPART> 
     Removes any and all partition or volume formatting from the disk with
     focus.

Syntax:  CLEAN [ALL]

    ALL         Specifies that each and every sector on the disk is set to
                zero, which completely deletes all data contained on the disk.

    On master boot record (MBR) disks, only the MBR partitioning information
    and hidden sector information are overwritten. On GUID partition table
    (GPT) disks, the GPT partitioning information, including the Protective
    MBR, is overwritten. There is no hidden sector information.

Example:

    CLEAN
