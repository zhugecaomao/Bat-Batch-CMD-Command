DISKPART> 
    Repairs the RAID-5 volume with focus by replacing the failed RAID-5 member
    with the specified dynamic disk.

Syntax:  REPAIR DISK=<N> [ALIGN=<N>] [NOERR]

    DISK=<N>    Specifies the dynamic disk that will replace the failed RAID-5
                member. The specified disk must have free space equal to or
                larger than the total size of the failed RAID-5 member.

    ALIGN=<N>   Typically used with hardware RAID Logical Unit Number (LUN)
                arrays to improve performance. Aligns all volume or partition
                extents to the closest alignment boundary. N is the number of
                kilobytes (KB) from the beginning of the disk to the closest
                alignment boundary.

    NOERR       For scripting only. When an error is encountered, DiskPart
                continues to process commands as if the error did not occur.
                Without the NOERR parameter, an error causes DiskPart to exit
                with an error code.

    The specified dynamic disk must have free space greater than or equal to
    the total size of the failed RAID-5 member.

    A RAID-5 volume must be selected for this operation to succeed.

Example:

    REPAIR DISK=1
