DESCRIPTION:
        Queries the service security identifier (SID) type 
        setting of a service. 

        If this setting is "unrestricted", the Service Control 
        Manager (SCM) will add this service's SID to the service 
        process token when the service process starts the next 
        time due to the first service in the process being started.  
        This setting is valid only for Win32 user mode services. 

        If this setting is "restricted", the Service Control 
        Manager (SCM) will add this service's SID to the service 
        process token when the service process starts the next 
        time due to the first service in the process being started. 
        In addition, this service's SID will also be added to
        the restricting SID list in the process token. The process
        token will be a restricted token.  See MSDN for details on
        restricted token. This setting is valid only for Win32 
        user mode services. In addition, for a share process service,
        all services cohosted in the process must have this SID type
        set for this to take effect.
        
        If this setting is "none", the SCM will not add the service's 
        SID to the service process token.       
USAGE:
        sc <server> qsidtype [service name]
