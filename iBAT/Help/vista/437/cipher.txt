Displays or alters the encryption of directories [files] on NTFS partitions.

    /B        Abort if an error is encountered.  By default, CIPHER continues 
              executing even if errors are encountered.  
    /C        Displays information on the encrypted file. 
    /D        Decrypts the specified files or directories. 
    /E        Encrypts the specified files or directories. Directories will be 
              marked so that files added afterward will be encrypted. The 
              encrypted file could become decrypted when it is modified if the
              parent directory is not encrypted. It is recommended that you 
              encrypt the file and the parent directory.
    /H        Displays files with the hidden or system attributes.  These
              files are omitted by default.
    /K        Creates a new certificate and key for use with EFS. If
              this option is chosen, all the other options will be ignored.
    /N        This option only works with /U. This will prevent keys being
              updated. This is used to find all the encrypted files on the 
              local drives.
    /R        Generates an EFS recovery agent key and certificate, then writes
              them to a .PFX file (containing certificate and private key) and 
              a .CER file (containing only the certificate). An administrator
              may add the contents of the .CER to the EFS recovery policy to 
              create the recovery agent for users, and import the .PFX to 
              recover individual files.  If SMARTCARD is specified, then writes
              the recovery key and certificate to a smart card.  A .CER file is 
              generated (containing only the certificate).  No .PFX file is 
              generated.              
    /S        Performs the specified operation on directories in the given
              directory and all subdirectories.
    /U        Tries to touch all the encrypted files on local drives. This will
              update user's file encryption key or recovery agent's key to the
              current ones if they are changed. This option does not work with
              other options except /N.
    /W        Removes data from available unused disk space on the entire 
              volume. If this option is chosen, all other options are ignored.
              The directory specified can be anywhere in a local volume. If it 
              is a mount point or points to a directory in another volume, the
              data on that volume will be removed.
    /X        Backup EFS certificate and keys into file filename. If efsfile is
              provided, the current user's certificate(s) used to encrypt the
              file will be backed up. Otherwise, the user's current EFS 
              certificate and keys will be backed up.
    /Y        Displays your current EFS certificate thumbnail on the local PC.
    /ADDUSER  Adds a user to the specified encrypted file(s).  If CERTHASH is
              provided, cipher will search for a certificate with this SHA1 
              hash.  If CERTFILE is provided, cipher will extract the 
              certificate from the file. 
    /REKEY    Updates the specified encrypted file(s) to use the configured
              EFS current key.
    /REMOVEUSER     Removes a user from the specified file(s).  CERTHASH
              must be the SHA1 hash of the certificate to remove. 
    
    directory A directory path.
    filename  A filename without extensions.
    pathname  Specifies a pattern, file or directory.
    efsfile   An encrypted file path.

    Used without parameters, CIPHER displays the encryption state of
    the current directory and any files it contains. You may use multiple
    directory names and wildcards.  You must put spaces between multiple
    parameters.
