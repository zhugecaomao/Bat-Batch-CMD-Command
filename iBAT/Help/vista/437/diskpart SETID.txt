    Changes the partition type field for the partition with focus.

Syntax:  SET ID={<BYTE> | <GUID>} [OVERRIDE] [NOERR]

    ID={<BYTE> | <GUID>}

                Specifies the new partition type.

                For master boot record (MBR) disks, you can specify a partition
                type byte, in hexadecimal form, for the partition. Any
                partition type byte can be specified with this parameter except
                for type 42 (LDM partition).

                For GUID partition table (GPT) disks you can specify a
                partition type GUID for the partition. Recognized GUIDs
                include:

                    EFI System partition:
                        c12a7328-f81f-11d2-ba4b-00a0c93ec93b

                    Basic data partition:
                        ebd0a0a2-b9e5-4433-87c0-68b6b72699c7

                Any partition type GUID can be specified with this parameter
                except for the following:

                    Microsoft Reserved partition:
                        e3c9e316-0b5c-4db8-817d-f92df00215ae

                    LDM Metadata partition on a dynamic disk:
                        5808c8aa-7e8f-42e0-85d2-e1e90434cfb3

                    LDM Data partition on a dynamic disk:
                        af9b60a0-1431-4f62-bc68-3311714a69ad

                Other than the limitations mentioned, DiskPart otherwise does
                not check the partition type for validity except to ensure that
                it is a byte in hexadecimal form or a GUID.

    OVERRIDE    Enables DiskPart to force the volume to dismount first if
                necessary. All opened handles to the volume will become
                invalid.

    NOERR       For scripting only. When an error is encountered, DiskPart
                continues to process commands as if the error did not occur.
                Without the NOERR parameter, an error causes DiskPart to exit
                with an error code.

    Intended for Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) use only.

    A partition must be selected for this operation to succeed.

    Caution:

        Changing partition type fields with this parameter might cause your
        computer to fail or be unable to start up. Unless you are an OEM or an
        IT professional experienced with GPT disks, do not change partition
        type fields on GPT disks using this parameter. Instead, always use the
        CREATE PARTITION EFI command to create EFI System partitions, the
        CREATE PARTITION MSR command to create Microsoft Reserved partitions,
        and the CREATE PARTITION PRIMARY command without the ID parameter to
        create primary partitions on GPT disks.

    This command does not work on dynamic disks nor on Microsoft Reserved
    partitions.

    Example:

    SET ID=07 OVERRIDE
    SET ID=ebd0a0a2-b9e5-4433-87c0-68b6b72699c7
