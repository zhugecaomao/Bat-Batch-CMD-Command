    Enables or disables the automount feature.

Syntax:  AUTOMOUNT [ENABLE] [DISABLE] [SCRUB] [NOERR]

    ENABLE      Enables Windows to automatically mount new basic volumes that
                are added to the system and to assign them drive letters.

    DISABLE     Prevents Windows from automatically mounting any new basic
                volumes that are added to the system.

    SCRUB       Removes volume mount point directories and registry settings
                for volumes that are no longer in the system. This prevents
                volumes that were previously in the system from being
                automatically mounted and given their former volume mount
                point(s) when they are added back to the system.

    NOERR       For scripting only. When an error is encountered, DiskPart
                continues to process commands as if the error did not occur.
                Without the NOERR parameter, an error causes DiskPart to exit
                with an error code.

    When the automount feature is enabled (the default), Windows automatically
    mounts the file system for a new basic volume when it is added to the
    system and then assigns a drive letter to the volume. In storage area
    network (SAN) configurations, disabling automount prevents Windows from
    automatically mounting or assigning drive letters to any new basic volumes
    that are visible to the system.

Example:

    AUTOMOUNT
    AUTOMOUNT ENABLE
    AUTOMOUNT DISABLE
