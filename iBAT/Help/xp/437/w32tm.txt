w32tm [/? | /register | /unregister ]
  ? - this help screen.
  register - register to run as a service and add default
    configuration to the registry.
  unregister - unregister service and remove all configuration
    information from the registry.

w32tm /monitor [/domain:<domain name>]
               [/computers:<name>[,<name>[,<name>...]]]
               [/threads:<num>]
  domain - specifies which domain to monitor. If no domain name
    is given, or neither the domain nor computers option is
    specified, the default domain is used. This option may be
    used more than once.
  computers - monitors the given list of computers. Computer
    names are separated by commas, with no spaces. If a name is
    prefixed with a '*', it is treated as a PDC. This option
    may be used more than once.
  threads - how many computers to analyze simultaneously. The
    default value is 3. Allowed range is 1-50.

w32tm /ntte <NT time epoch>
  Convert a NT system time, in (10^-7)s intervals from 0h 1-Jan 1601,
  into a readable format.

w32tm /ntpte <NTP time epoch>
  Convert an NTP time, in (2^-32)s intervals from 0h 1-Jan 1900, into
  a readable format.

w32tm /resync [/computer:<computer>] [/nowait] [/rediscover] [/soft]
  Tell a computer that it should resynchronize its clock as soon
  as possible, throwing out all accumulated error statistics.
  computer:<computer> - computer that should resync. If not
    specified, the local computer will resync.
  nowait - do not wait for the resync to occur;
    return immediately. Otherwise, wait for the resync to
    complete before returning.
  rediscover - redetect the network configuration and rediscover
    network sources, then resynchronize.
  soft - resync utilizing existing error statistics. Not useful,
    provided for compatibility.

w32tm /stripchart /computer:<target> [/period:<refresh>]
    [/dataonly] [/samples:<count>]
  Display a strip chart of the offset between this computer and
  another computer.
  computer:<target> - the computer to measure the offset against.
  period:<refresh> - the time between samples, in seconds. The
    default is 2s
  dataonly - display only the data, no graphics.
  samples:<count> - collect <count> samples, then stop. If not
    specified, samples will be collected until Ctrl-C is pressed.

w32tm /config [/computer:<target>] [/update]
    [/manualpeerlist:<peers>] [/syncfromflags:<source>]
    [/LocalClockDispersion:<seconds>]
  computer:<target> - adjusts the configuration of <target>. If not
    specified, the default is the local computer.
  update - notifies the time service that the configuration has
    changed, causing the changes to take effect.
  manualpeerlist:<peers> - sets the manual peer list to <peers>,
    which is a space-delimited list of DNS and/or IP addresses.
    When specifying multiple peers, this switch must be enclosed in
    quotes.
  syncfromflags:<source> - sets what sources the NTP client should
    sync from. <source> should be a comma separated list of
    these keywords (not case sensitive):
      MANUAL - include peers from the manual peer list
      DOMHIER - sync from a DC in the domain hierarchy

w32tm /tz
  Display the current time zone settings.

w32tm /dumpreg [/subkey:<key>] [/computer:<target>]
  Display the values associated with a given registry key.
  The default key is HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time
    (the root key for the time service).
  subkey:<key> - displays the values associated with subkey <key> of the default
 key.
  computer:<target> - queries registry settings for computer <target>
