Description:
    This command line tool enables an administrator to control
    the power settings on a system.

Parameter List:
    /LIST, /L       Lists the names of existing power schemes.
    /QUERY, /Q      Displays the configuration of the specified power scheme.
                    If no name is specified, the configuration of the currently
                    active power scheme is displayed.
    /CREATE, /C     Creates a power scheme with the specified name.  The new
                    scheme is created with the properties of the currently
                    active scheme.
    /DELETE, /D     Deletes the power scheme with the specified name.
    /SETACTIVE, /S  Makes the power scheme with the specified name active.
    /CHANGE, /X     Changes settings of the specified power scheme. Additional
                    switches specify the changes as follows:
                        /monitor-timeout-ac <minutes>
                        /monitor-timeout-dc <minutes>
                        /disk-timeout-ac <minutes>
                        /disk-timeout-dc <minutes>
                        /standby-timeout-ac <minutes>
                        /standby-timeout-dc <minutes>
                        /hibernate-timeout-ac <minutes>
                        /hibernate-timeout-dc <minutes>
                        /processor-throttle-ac <throttle>
                        /processor-throttle-dc <throttle>
                    AC settings are used when the system is on AC power.
                    DC settings are used when the system is on battery power.
                    Setting a timeout to zero will disable the corresponding
                    timeout feature.  Supported throttle settings are NONE
                    CONSTANT, DEGRADE, and ADAPTIVE.
    /EXPORT, /E     Exports the power scheme with the specified name to a
                    file.  If no filename is specified, the default is
                    SCHEME.POW.  This additional parameter is supported:
                        /FILE <filename>
    /IMPORT, /I     Imports the power scheme from a file under the specified
                    name.  If no filename is specified, the default is
                    SCHEME.POW.  If a scheme with that name already exists, it
                    is replaced with the new one.  This additional parameter
                    is supported:
                        /FILE <filename>
    /HIBERNATE, /H {ON|OFF}  Enables/Disables the hibernate feature.  Hibernate
                    timeout is not supported on all systems.
    /NUMERICAL, /N  Allows the power scheme to be operated upon to be specified
                    using a numerical identifier.  When using this switch, in
                    place of the name of the power scheme on the command line,
                    specify its numerical identifier.  This switch may be used
                    in combination with the /QUERY, /DELETE, /SETACTIVE,
                    /CHANGE, /EXPORT, and /IMPORT commands.
    /GLOBALPOWERFLAG, /G {ON|OFF}  Turns one of the global power flags on/off.
                    Valid flags (to be used after "/OPTION ") are:
                         BATTERYICON:    Turns the battery meter icon in the
                                         system tray on/off.
                         MULTIBATTERY:   Turns on/off multiple battery display
                                         in system Power Meter.
                         RESUMEPASSWORD: Prompt for password on resuming the
                                         system.
                         WAKEONRING:     Turn on/off wake on ring support.
                         VIDEODIM:       Turn on/off support for dimming video
                                         display on battery power.
    /AVAILABLESLEEPSTATES, /A  Reports the sleep states available on the
                    system.  Attempts to report reasons why sleep states are
                    unavailable.
    /BATTERYALARM, /B {LOW|CRITICAL}  Configures the battery alarm.  The
                    following switches can be specified:

                            The alarm will be activated when the power level
                            reaches this percentage.
                        /text <on|off>
