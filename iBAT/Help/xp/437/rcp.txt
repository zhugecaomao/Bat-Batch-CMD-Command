RCP [-a | -b] [-h] [-r] [host][.user:]source [host][.user:] path\destination

  -a                 Specifies ASCII transfer mode. This mode converts
                     the EOL characters to a carriage return for UNIX
                     and a carriage
                     return/line feed for personal computers. This is
                     the default transfer mode.
  -b                 Specifies binary image transfer mode.
  -h                 Transfers hidden files.
  -r                 Copies the contents of all subdirectories;
                     destination must be a directory.
  host               Specifies the local or remote host. If host is
                     specified as an IP address OR if host name contains
                     dots, you must specify the user.
  .user:             Specifies a user name to use, rather than the
                     current user name.
  source             Specifes the files to copy.
  path\destination   Specifies the path relative to the logon directory
                     on the remote host. Use the escape characters
                     (\ , ", or ') in remote paths to use wildcard
                     characters on the remote host.
