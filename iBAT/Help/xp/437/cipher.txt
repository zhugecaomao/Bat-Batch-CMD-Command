    /A        Operates on files as well as directories. The encrypted file
              could become decrypted when it is modified if the parent
              directory is not encrypted. It is recommended that you encrypt
              the file and the parent directory.
    /D        Decrypts the specified directories. Directories will be marked
              so that files added afterward will not be encrypted.
    /E        Encrypts the specified directories. Directories will be marked
              so that files added afterward will be encrypted.
    /F        Forces the encryption operation on all specified objects, even
              those which are already encrypted.  Already-encrypted objects
              are skipped by default.
    /H        Displays files with the hidden or system attributes.  These
              files are omitted by default.
    /I        Continues performing the specified operation even after errors
              have occurred.  By default, CIPHER stops when an error is
              encountered.
    /K        Creates new file encryption key for the user running CIPHER. If
              this option is chosen, all the other options will be ignored.
    /N        This option only works with /U. This will prevent keys being
              updated. This is used to find all the encrypted files on the
              local drives.
    /Q        Reports only the most essential information.
    /R        Generates an EFS recovery agent key and certificate, then writes
              them to a .PFX file (containing certificate and private key) and
              a .CER file (containing only the certificate). An administrator
              may add the contents of the .CER to the EFS recovery policy to
              create the recovery agent for users, and import the .PFX to
              recover individual files.
    /S        Performs the specified operation on directories in the given
              directory and all subdirectories.
    /U        Tries to touch all the encrypted files on local drives. This will
              update user's file encryption key or recovery agent's key to the
              current ones if they are changed. This option does not work with
              other options except /N.
    /W        Removes data from available unused disk space on the entire
              volume. If this option is chosen, all other options are ignored.
              The directory specified can be anywhere in a local volume. If it
              is a mount point or points to a directory in another volume, the
              data on that volume will be removed.
    /X        Backup EFS certificate and keys into file filename. If efsfile is
              provided, the current user's certificate(s) used to encrypt the
              file will be backed up. Otherwise, the user's current EFS
              certificate and keys will be backed up.


    directory A directory path.
    filename  A filename without extensions.
    pathname  Specifies a pattern, file or directory.
    efsfile   An encrypted file path.

    Used without parameters, CIPHER displays the encryption state of
    the current directory and any files it contains. You may use multiple
    directory names and wildcards.  You must put spaces between multiple
    parameters.
