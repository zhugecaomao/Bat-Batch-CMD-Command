changing the sampling rate and/or converting the file format. Supports all
performance log formats, including Windows NT 4.0 compressed logs.

Usage:
relog <filename [filename ...]> [options]

Parameters:
  <filename [filename ...]>     Performance file to relog.

Options:
  -?                            Displays context sensitive help.

  -c <path [path ...]>          Counters to filter from input log.
  -cf <filename>                File listing performance counters to filter
                                form the input log. Default is all counters
                                in the original log file.

  -config <filename>            Settings file containing command options.
  -q                            List performance counters in the input file.
