DESCRIPTION:
        Changes the service security identifier (SID) type
        setting of a service. If this setting is "unrestricted",
        the Service Control Manager (SCM) will add this service's
        SID to the service process token when the service process
        starts the next time due to the first service in the process
        being started.  This setting is valid only for Win32 user mode
        services configured in accounts other than LocalSystem. If this
        setting is "none", the SCM will not add the service's SID to the
        service process token.
USAGE:
        sc <server> sidtype [service name] [type]
OPTIONS:
        type = <none|unrestricted>
