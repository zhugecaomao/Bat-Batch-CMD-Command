        Run without arguments this program will tell you if the
        system exhibits the Pentium floating point division error
        and whether floating point emulation is forced and whether floating
        point hardware is disabled.

    -h
    -H

    -c  Turn on conditional emulation. This means that floating
    -C  point emulation will be forced on if and only if
        the system detects the Pentium floating point division
        error at boot. Reboot required before this takes effect.
        This is what should generally be used.

    -f  Turn on forced emulation.  This means that floating
    -F  point hardware is disabled and floating point emulation
        will always be forced on, regardless of whether the system
        exhibits the Pentium division error. Useful for testing
        software emulators and for working around floating point
        hardware defects unknown to the OS. Reboot required before
        this takes effect.

    -o  Turn off forced emulation. Reenables floating point hardware
    -O  if present. Reboot required before this takes effect.

The Floating Point Division error that this program addresses only
occurs on certain Intel Pentium processors. It only affects floating
point operations. The problem is described in detail in a white paper
available from Intel. If you are doing critical work with programs that
perform floating point division and certain related functions that
use the same hardware (including remainder and transcendtal functions),
you may wish to use this program to force emulation.
